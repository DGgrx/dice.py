### This is the first pyhton project I made inspired by an Udemy Bootcamp Course that i enrolled in. I followed along and carried out my own implementation of the same.

This code can be run by 

'''sh
python3 dice.py 
'''

## Features : 

- You can choose to throw multiple dice at once.

This was fairly easy to code. You can also suggest some changes to optimize this.
